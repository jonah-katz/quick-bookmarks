quick-bookmarks
===============

Quick bookmarks is a chrome extension that simply lists all user bookmark folders and their corresponding bookmark children on click, in an AJAX fashion. The main purpose of this extension's development was to expirement with Backbone.js, Require.js and Underscore.js and their compatibility within a chrome extension. 

If you'd like to contribute, here are some features that would be useful (but ofcourse, feel free to add anything you see fit) :

  - add bookmarks
  - add folders
  - move bookmarks
  - sort bookmarks (date, name, etc.)
  - search bookmarks
